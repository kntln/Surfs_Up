The purpose of this project is to analyze the weather data set of Oahu. This analysis will allow investors to determine the feasibility and sustainability of opening a surf's shop and ice cream shop. The weather data for the last twelve months were analyzed based on two parameters, precipitation and temperature. These two parameters are important factors that can affect the profitability of the shop. Moreoever, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, will be analyzed in detail in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

## Summary
Overall, based on the weather data, the analysis suggests that the weather in Oauhu can sustain Surf n' Shake year round. For instance the average precipitation for August 2016 to August 2017 shows that it does not rain in Oauhu for majority of the year. Similarly, the average temperature for the month of June and December are not drastically different from one another. This implies that the temperature in Oauhu is consistent and will not vastly affect the profitability of the surf and ice cream shop. 

The two additional queries that can be performed to gather more weather data for June and December are first, a query can be written to check the precipitation of September which is the mid point between June and December.The second additional query can be written to analyze the September temperature. Writing these two additional queries can help the investors acquire a full picture of the weather of Oauhu in order to determine the sustainability of opening a surf's shop and ice cream shop.
